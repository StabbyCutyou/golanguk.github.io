Go is the language of the server, but it's not yet reached a critical mass in the modern enterprise. This talk describes Go kit, a toolkit for microservices in larger tech organizations. Learn about the motivation for its existence, how it's progressed so far, its architectural philosophy of declarative composition, and the ways in which it's opinionated. In the end, we'll build an example service, utilizing each of the Go kit components.
