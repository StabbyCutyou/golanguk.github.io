Go is a simple language with a very small grammar, which makes building tools for the language quite enjoyable. 

This talk covers different techniques that you can use to analyze a given program without having to read a single line of code. From tools to measure the quality and complexity of a program to ones that pinpoint bugs and performance issues. 

We will discuss the limits of what static analysis can understand and how dynamic analysis techniques can help us breach the gap between theory and usability.
