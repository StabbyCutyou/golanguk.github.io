We often think of “The Go Community” as a single entity. But different species of Gopher interact in different ways: Email, IRC, Twitter, in person, or perhaps not at all. How do we maintain the underlying “gopherness” (if any) as these communities grow? How do we keep these groups communities that we (and others) want to be a part of going forward? And why bother worrying about community anyway? 

This talk will present my view of these communities, how my own involvement has changed and grown over time, reflect on some of the growing pains I’ve seen, and present ideas for encouraging a positive Gopher environment.
