io.Reader, io.Writer, and io.ReadWriter are some of the most powerful, yet surprisingly subtle, tools in the Go standard library. In this talk, we'll explore two concrete examples leveraging these building blocks to construct expressive and performant abstractions. We'll also cover details of package bufio, the LimitReader, and other techniques to rain kittens on our code and dial it up to 11.
