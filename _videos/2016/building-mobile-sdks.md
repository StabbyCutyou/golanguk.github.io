You have built your shiny backend API for your Kitten as a Service platform and whilst you've tried to keep the API contract small and succinct the the uptake has been no where near as fast as you wanted, mobile developers are not integrating your API into their apps.<br><br>The key problem is that pretty much everyone is lazy, I am and so are you, admit it.  We want to concentrate our time writing application features not writing scaffold and integration code, as an API provider this is why you need an easy to use SDK for others to consume.<br><br>In this talk I will run through such an example and will show you step by step just how easy it is to leverage the power of Go to create native performing SDKs for both iOS and Android.  Of course this is but a small part of what you can achieve with GoMobile but the techniques you will learn in this session will equip you to take things to the next level.
