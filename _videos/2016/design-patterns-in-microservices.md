Microservices is a talk of the town. Newer protocols like GRPC and frameworks like Gokit make us the armchair architects who have seen it all. But let's take a step back into thinking what are the common design patterns in building a microservices architectures. Varying from Request Response, Signal Slots, Service Discovery, Load Balancing, Error handling &nbsp; Monitoring. Then through code samples and demos we address these using Gilmour, a microservices Library over non-HTTP transports.
