As an electrical engineer, both in college and at Intel, my exposure to software development was limited. I have been interested in software development, began learning on my own and then I got an opportunity to shift inside Intel. The team I joined was writing code in Go and I had a lot to learn quite quickly. For those who are new to Go and learning the language, having the right resources, especially early on, can make all the difference. Without knowing where to find them, a lot of time can be spent searching. I want to share what helped me accelerate my learning, which is not over, by the way, and never will be.
