Go has been widely successful for creating tools and infrastructure, but the simplicity of the language also makes for an excellent fit for implementing core business applications. We will look at a few patterns for domain objects and code organization and hopefully we'll take some additional steps towards Go in the modern enterprise. During this talk we will look at a sample application that demonstrates how a core domain could be implemented in Go. Hopefully, it will serve as leverage and inspiration for developers that want to write their next enterprise service in Go rather than using the traditional Java stack.
