      Programming since age 6 (Mat would type BASIC code out from computer magazines with his father to make little programs and games), Mat has always had a keen obsession with programming. When Go came along, he loved the philosophy and the elegance of the language, and has been using it since before v1. In 2015 his first book Go Programming Blueprints was published. Today he works for GrayMeta, employing his Go expertise in this exciting LA-based big meta-data company. He spoke at Gophercon in 2014 in Denver, Colorado and the UK’s Go conference in August 2015 and 2016 as well as infoShare in Poland and ProgsCon in London. He founded Testify and Silk testing packages.
