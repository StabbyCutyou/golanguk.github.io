              Ultimate Go is a class for any intermediate-level developer who has some experience with other programming languages and wants to learn Go. This class provides an intensive, comprehensive and idiomatic view of the language. We focus on both the specification and implementation of the language, including topics ranging from language syntax, Go’s type system, concurrency, channels, testing and more. We believe this class is perfect for anyone who wants a jump start in learning Go or who wants a more thorough understanding of the language and its internals. <a href="/workshop-day">More details</a> or <a href="/tickets">Buy tickets</a>

                Go's GC is optimised for low latency applications. In this talk we'll see how it works (the tricolor algorithm), why it works (achieving such short GC pauses), and most importantly, whether it works (benchmarking these GC pauses, and comparing them with other languages).

               Like most programming languages, Go uses English keywords. But Go's unique approach to byte and string handling makes it the ideal candidate for a universal programming language that can be localized to allow English-speaking and non-English speaking developers to collaborate on the same projects.

               I’m the Technical Lead for Digital Publishing at Office for National Statistics. I’ve been working with Go since 2013, after ditching Perl, and introduced it to two Civil Service departments - Companies House and ONS. I build websites, APIs and ‘backend’ stuff - but I’m terrible at anything visual except animated gradients. I’m also a below-average photographer and have a notable panda obsession.
