              Ultimate Go is a class for any intermediate-level developer who has some experience with other programming languages and wants to learn Go. This class provides an intensive, comprehensive and idiomatic view of the language. We focus on both the specification and implementation of the language, including topics ranging from language syntax, Go’s type system, concurrency, channels, testing and more. We believe this class is perfect for anyone who wants a jump start in learning Go or who wants a more thorough understanding of the language and its internals. <a href="/workshop-day">More details</a> or <a href="/tickets">Buy tickets</a>

               Programming since age 6 (Mat would type BASIC code out from computer magazines with his father to make little programs and games), Mat has always had a keen obsession with programming. When Go came along, he loved the philosophy and the elegance of the language, and has been using it since before v1. In 2015 his first book Go Programming Blueprints was published. Today he works for GrayMeta, employing his Go expertise in this exciting LA-based big meta-data company. He spoke at Gophercon in 2014 in Denver, Colorado and the UK’s Go conference in August 2015 and 2016 as well as infoShare in Poland and ProgsCon in London. He founded Testify and Silk testing packages.

                Go's GC is optimised for low latency applications. In this talk we'll see how it works (the tricolor algorithm), why it works (achieving such short GC pauses), and most importantly, whether it works (benchmarking these GC pauses, and comparing them with other languages).

               Like most programming languages, Go uses English keywords. But Go's unique approach to byte and string handling makes it the ideal candidate for a universal programming language that can be localized to allow English-speaking and non-English speaking developers to collaborate on the same projects.
