              Go is a modern programming language with a heavy focus on developer productivity, scalability, and speed. Whether you're a recent grad or an industry veteran, there's no better time to learn the core concepts of the Go programming language. This course introduces language fundamentals, such as primitives, language structure, design, and concurrency. If you have little or no experience with Go and want to jumpstart your knowledge, this course is for you. <br><br><a href="/workshop-day">More details</a> or <a href="/tickets">Buy tickets</a>

              Go is a modern programming language with a heavy focus on developer productivity, scalability, and speed. Concepts such as concurrent programming, testing, and performance testing were designed into the language from the beginning. If you want to learn about concurrent programing, or how to performance test and profile your code, this course is for you. <br><br><a href="/workshop-day">More details</a> or <a href="/tickets">Buy tickets</a>

            description: |
                Kubernetes is the de-facto industry standard for container orchestration. In this workshop you’ll learn how to program Kubernetes using Go. We will start with the basic concepts (pods, namespace, labels, workloads, nodes, events, etc.) and provide step by step guidance how to implement a variety of tasks against the Kubernetes API with the Go programming language. The two main Go libraries used in this workshop will be https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go as well as https://github.com/openshift/client-go in addition to the Go standard library. For each participant, access to a Kubernetes cluster will be provided, and it is beneficial if you have the latest Go version installed on your laptop in order to follow along. We will provide a GitHub repo with all code samples used in the workshop. <br><br><a href="/workshop-day">More details</a> or <a href="/tickets">Buy tickets</a>

                As developers we’re dealing with an increasing pressure to deliver features ever faster. This talk will walk you through a number of development and delivery models for Go. We’ll be starting with the traditional binary-running-on-a-VM setup, then move on to container-based development and further on to the serverless/Function-as-a-service model using AWS Lambda and Apache OpenWhisk on Kubernetes. We’ll be using the same codebase, effectively starting with a monolith, breaking in down into (containerized) microservices and further on breaking it down to a dozen functions. For each of the development and deployment models we’ll discuss pros and cons and trying to determine their respective sweet-spot. This is a hands-on, minimum-slides session.

                The Go community is definitely the best feature of the language, but how may we engage with it and become more than just a bystander on the crowd? How do we contribute to the Go language OSS? Too much for you? What about a community built library? Contributing with code is too scary? What about building samples and documenting? Maybe you are a local leader and you can start a meetup, or join an active one… Do you like to write? Record videos? Literally the options are endless, so I want to explore some of those while sharing my personal experiences with the hopes of inspiring other people to engage with the community as well.

                This talk will cover the basics of creating good Docker images for your Go projects using multi-stage builds. Once we have that image ready we will need to run it somewhere, I think that a Kubernetes cluster could be a nice place to start. Of course, we don’t want to repeat those steps by hand everytime we want to do a new deployment so we will probably need to learn how to use a CI/CD tool to automate all the steps. And finally, the icing on the cake would be make this automagically run everytime we push code to our repository.

On the way we'll present libraries we built using this philosophy as well as take a dip in the deep sea of HTTP1/HTTP2 handling in Go.

                TDD is great, but it's just the start -- if you plan to write real robust services at scale, you need ODD, or Observability-Driven Development. Let's talk about how to ship code to production and then understand what you have *actually* shipped, as opposed to what you *think* you have shipped.

                Complex systems call for better controllability over various design parameters (data and control widths, on-/off- chip memory, topology etc.). Unlike software based simulations, rapid FPGA-accelerated prototyping (using GoPro) will allow faster simulation and exploration of large scale systems.
