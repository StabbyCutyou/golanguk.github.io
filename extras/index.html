              <a href="http://twitter.com/matryer">Mat Ryer</a> is organising a trip to the famed <a href="https://bletchleypark.org.uk">Bletchley Park</a>. Early computers were used at Bletchley Park during World War II by the Codebreakers, including Alan Turing, to decipher military codes and ciphers which contributed to ending the war 4 years sooner than expected. Bletchley Park has many computer science related attractions and exhibits which will provide for a fun and enriching day out for a group of Gophers.
